Bugs:

File "/homes/nate.hills/csci335/phase3/ph3_FirstNationalBankOfThug/program/Controller.py", line 149, in ParsePos
     answer = self.context.query(input)
 AttributeError: 'Controller' object has no attribute 'context'

When we first solve it plots with the correct dimensions, but if you replot it with different dimensions it doesnt change

Still printing out inflow and outflow lists

plotting doesm't switch the dimensions (after you re solve) unless you press p, stream, mesh

plot error causes a segmentation fault

loading doesn't work in controller.py

need to change error when we refine
