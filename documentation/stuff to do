Done:
Added Ids:
    creation
    eq
    poly
    state
    dim_*
    mesh_*
    reyn
    pos_*
    flow_*
    func_*
    solve
    clear
    solution
    plot_type
    plot
    refine_type
    refine
    m_refine
    load
    load_file
    save
    save_file
Stuff to do:

Needs Id (and other changes):
    Plot 
    Energy error

If input is invalid, red the box
Regular expression to parse position stuff
    Use the string "([x,y][=,>,<]/d+)+" Maybe <=, >=, =<, >=  from stackoverflow r"Test(\d*(?:\.\d+))"
Use interpreter2.py to interpreter functions
Depending on the state of inflow and outflow grey out

if Navier Stokes its always steady state
Submit will check all of the input and make red if wrong
Derek/the back end will send the specifications for teh solve() pass -1 in the reyNum if stokes

Might have a load where it resets the settings in the Creation tab
save/load will call save(filename) or load(filename)
load will return a list of things to be placed into the options in the Creation tab
