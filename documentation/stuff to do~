Done:
Added Ids:
    creation
    eq
    poly
    state
    dim_*
    mesh_*
    reyn
    pos_*
    flow_*
    func_*
    solve
    clear
    solution
    plot_type
    plot
    refine_type
    refine
    m_refine
    load
    load_file
    save
    save_file
    plot
    error
Stuff to do:

Regular expression to parse position stuff
    Use the string "([x,y][=,>,<]/d+)+" Maybe <=, >=, =<, >=  from stackoverflow r"Test(\d*(?:\.\d+))"
Depending on the state of inflow and outflow grey out
if Navier Stokes its always steady state
Submit will check all of the input and make red if wrong
Derek/the back end will send the specifications for teh solve() pass -1 in the reyNum if stokes

Fix interpreter
Bridge the stuff
    manualRefine(type, numbers) gives energy error
    autoRefine(type) gives energy error
    solve(lots of stuff [inflow tuples of strings], [outflow list of strings]) gives energy error
    plot(type) returns image?? options u1, u2, p, stream, mesh, error
    save(string) *
    load(string) * (maybe return all the stuff)


Might have a load where it resets the settings in the Creation tab
save/load will call save(filename) or load(filename)
load will return a list of things to be placed into the options in the Creation tab
